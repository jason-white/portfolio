I'm Jason White, a Design Engineer with multiple years of experience building intuitive, scalable front-end solutions for the web. Proficient in semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility standards, I specialize in designing, prototyping, and building user-centric interfaces that prioritize inclusivity and functionality.
