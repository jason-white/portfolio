## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jason White, a UX/UI engineer with multiple years of experience building intuitive, scalable front-end solutions for the web. Proficient in semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility standards, I specialize in designing, prototyping, and building user-centric interfaces that prioritize inclusivity and functionality.

Here are some [case studies](/case-studies/) that showcase my work as both a UX/UI designer and engineer.
